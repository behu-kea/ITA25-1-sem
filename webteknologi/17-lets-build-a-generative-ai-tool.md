# Let's build a Generative AI tool



## Learning objectives

- Working with a text-to-text model
- Writing prompts
- Using API's



<!--

## Afterclass consideration

- Det var en god dag idag og det er fedt at se de studerendes kreativitet i spil. 
- De fik arbejdet en masse med prompting, hvilket var fedt at se
- Jeg tÃ¦nkte at kunne kÃ¸re projektet to gange, men det bliver nok lige lidt meget. De fÃ¥r tid til deres 5. tvÃ¦rfaglige projekt

-->



## Getting started

We first need to be able to interact with a LLM through some kind of API. That will make it possible for us to `fetch` some data in javascript and then use that data for our web application. There are alot of different ways of getting access to an api with a LLM behind. I will be going through some ways here:



It's up to you which way you choose!



### Huggingface API - Free

Huggingface is a machine learning and data science platform and community that helps users build, deploy and train machine learning models



On Huggingface we can find a LLM, deploy an API for that model that only we can use and then start sending requests to that API.



The following is 10 dishes that can be made with cinnamon



#### Deploying the model to get an API

We can for free deploy a LLM model on Hugging face the following way:

1. Create a new user at [https://huggingface.co/](https://huggingface.co/)

2. Go to [https://huggingface.co/tiiuae/falcon-7b-instruct](https://huggingface.co/tiiuae/falcon-7b-instruct)

3. Deploy the `falcon-7b-instruct` model

4. Create a new token

5. Click on New token

7. Go back and select the token

#### Using the API

Now to start working with the model i have created a template for you [here](https://github.com/behu-kea/ita24-1sem-code/blob/main/genai-test-js/hugging-face.js). You can also use the code below

```javascript
const API_KEY = "API_KEY_HERE"; // Replace with your actual API key

function logSuggestion() {
    fetch("https://api-inference.huggingface.co/models/tiiuae/falcon-7b-instruct/v1/chat/completions", {
        method: "POST",
        headers: {
            "Authorization": `Bearer ${API_KEY}`,
            "Content-Type": "application/json"
        },
        body: JSON.stringify({
            model: "meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct",
            messages: [
                {
                    role: "user",
                    content: "How do I add a new element to a JavaScript array?"
                }
            ],
            max_tokens: 500,
            stream: false
        })
    })
        .then(response => {
            if (!response.ok) {
                console.log(111);
                throw new Error(`Error: ${response.statusText}`);
            }
            return response.json();
        })
        .then(suggestionData => {
            console.log(suggestionData);
        })
        .catch(error => console.error(error));
}

logSuggestion();
```



ðŸš¨DON'T COMMIT YOUR KEYS TO GITHUB!!!ðŸš¨ **OBS!** Hvis i deployer linket, er det jeres credits der bliver brugt af!! I kan komme udenom det ved at lade brugerne indputte deres OpenAI key, ligesom [her](https://benna100.github.io/children-story-generator/)



### OpenAI API - not free (but very very cheap)

OpenAI has a really good api that is easy to use, very cheap (especially for get-3.5) and have smart models. 



Sign up here: [https://platform.openai.com/signup](https://platform.openai.com/signup)



To access the API you need an API key. Get that by going to [https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) and selecting `Create new secret key`. Copy the key.



**ðŸš¨VERY IMPORTANT!!!** To not suddenly having a **HUGE** bill, set up a limit of what you will spend. Do that by going to [https://platform.openai.com/account/limits](https://platform.openai.com/account/limits) and set a monthly budget!ðŸš¨

#### Using the API

Now to start working with the model i have created a template for you [here](https://github.com/behu-kea/ita24-1sem-code/blob/main/genai-test-js/openai.js). You can also use the code below

```javascript
const OPENAI_API_KEY = 'API_KEY_HERE'; // Replace with your actual API key

function logSuggestion() {
    fetch('https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions', {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {
            'Content-Type': 'application/json',
            'Authorization': `Bearer ${OPENAI_API_KEY}`
        },
        body: JSON.stringify({
            model: 'gpt-4o-mini',
            messages: [{
                role: 'user',
                content: 'Please respond with 10 dishes with tomatoes'
            }]
        })
    })
        .then(response => response.json())
        .then(suggestionData => console.log(suggestionData))
}

logSuggestion();
```

Where the value under the `content` key is your prompt. There are happening some other things too, but you can ignore that (the `POST`, `headers` etc)

If you want to know. Try and get ChatGPT to explain what the code does



There are lots of different endpoints within the OpenAI API. We will be using the [Chat endpoint](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat) that is also powering ChatGPT. OpenAI can also generate images through the API [here](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/images/object) or from audio to text or text to audio [here](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/audio). The possibilities are truly endless ðŸ¤¯



### Running a local model

A local model is a model that only runs on your computer. Its not as powerful but obviously private since nothing is sent to fx OpenAI

Ollama is a tool that easily lets you download, run and start an api on your won computer. It has lots of [different models](https://ollama.ai/library) to use

Works only on mac or linux for now (Windows coming soon)



Go to https://ollama.ai/ and download the tool. To find documentation go to: [https://github.com/jmorganca/ollama](https://github.com/jmorganca/ollama)

To run the model `llama2` open the terminal and write `ollama run llama2` 



#### Using the API

Now to start working with the model i have created a template for you [here](https://github.com/behu-kea/ita24-1sem-code/blob/main/genai-test-js/local-llm.js). You can also use the code below

```javascript
function logSuggestion() {
    fetch("http://localhost:11434/api/generate", {
        method: "POST",
        headers: {
            "Content-Type": "application/json"
        },
        body: JSON.stringify({
            model: "llama3.1:latest",
            prompt: `The following is a list of dishes you can make with the following ingredients: onion, carrots and cellery`,
            stream: false
        })
    })
        .then(response => response.json())
        .then(suggestionData => {
            console.log(suggestionData);
        })
        .catch(error => {
            console.error("Error:", error);
        });
}

logSuggestion();
```

**This will only work locally on your machine!** When deploying the website it cannot get the url `http://localhost:11434/api/generate`. To do that you need to deploy the ollama server to a server



Working code for these 3 Ways of working with LLM's can be found here: [https://github.com/behu-kea/ita24-1sem-code/tree/main/genai-test-js](https://github.com/behu-kea/ita24-1sem-code/tree/main/genai-test-js)
