# API, JSON and fetch - GIF search website



## Teacher instructions

- I will be going through how to interact with the giphy api in class
  - If you would like to figure that out by yourself, then you can work outside the class
  - Query parameters, path



## Learning objectives

- Working with API's
- Getting authentication key
- Reading documentation



<!--

## After class consideration

- Godt at lave gennemgang af hvordan man laver urlen man skal fetche til. Ellers havde det været ret svært

-->





## Giphy api

Create a site where a **user can search for any word**. When searching a word the application will **find a gif** using the **searched word** using the giphy api: [https://developers.giphy.com/docs/](https://developers.giphy.com/docs/)

Here is how it is going to work: The user can write some text indicating the gif he is looking for, click a button and then a gif will be found (using the searched word) and the gif will be displayed to the user.

Try break this problem into **smaller problems** and write down how you are going to solve the problem **BEFORE you start coding.**

I you are unsure of how to start you can off course ask me or you can try this prompt:
