### Question 1

Assume there is a button in the html page. What will happen when the button is clicked?

```javascript
const button = document.querySelector('button');
button.addEventListener('click', logMessage());

function logMessage() {
  console.log('Message');
}
```

1. The string `logMessage()` will be logged to the console
2. The string `Message` will be logged to the console
3. The string `logMessage` will be logged to the console
4. Nothing
5. Syntax error

    const getCheckBtn = document.querySelector('.check')
    const score = document.querySelector('.score')
    const highscore = document.querySelector('.highscore')
    const correctNumber = document.querySelector('.number')
    const scoreContainer = document.querySelector('.right')
    ```

    const getRandomNumber = () => {
        return Math.floor(Math.random() * 20 + 1)
    }

- Constructive Alignment

  - De arbejdsopgaver i har i klassen skal alignes med hvordan eksamen kommer til at forl칮be
    - I eksamen skal i kode og snakke om den kode. N친r jeg kommer ned til jer pr칮ver jeg b친de at hj칝lpe, men ogs친 at forberede jer p친 eksamen. 
    - I skal 칮ve det tekniske sprogbrug. Iterere et array, kalde en funktion. Den returnerer et array af objekter. Funktionen har 2 parametre, etc etc. 
    - Kodedelen er efter ChatGPT er kommet mindre vigtig. Det vigtige er hvordan i snakker om den kode i har lavet. Forst친r i hvad der sker og hvordan man m친ske kunne have grebet det anderledes an.

- Teach how to get value from different input elements (select, radio, input, etc.)

- Plan and create a bad timer app (mvp). 

- Also show xss
  - `<img src=x onerror=alert("XSS")>`
  - `<img src=x onerror=document.body.style.display="none">`
  - `<img src=x onerror=alert(document.querySelector(".user-account").innerText)>`





## Forms and input elements

Forms are used to send data from the client to a server. Often times you need to write your name, email, telephonenumber etc.



### Inputs

Inputs are used to get text from a user. This is how an input is defined 游녢 Notice that it is selfclosing! Like the `img` tag

```html
<input type="number"/>
```

This is probably the most famous input field ever

![Google input field](assets/input-field.png)

There are different types of input fields. One for numbers, text, telephone number, date. See them all [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input#input_types)



### Checkboxes

Checkboxes are used to get a value that can either be `true` or `false`. It is typically used for the remember me functionality

```html
<input type="checkbox">

<!--If the checkbox should be checked-->
<input type="checkbox" checked>
```

 

![Checkbox](assets/checkbox.png)



### Radio buttons

Radio buttons are used to select between a given set of options. 

```html
<input type="radio" id="email" name="contact" value="email">
<label for="email">Email</label>

<input type="radio" id="phone" name="contact" value="phone">
<label for="phone">Phone</label>

<input type="radio" id="mail" name="contact" value="mail">
<label for="mail">Mail</label>
```

The `label` tag shows the text for the radio button. What is important is that the `id` attribute and the `for` attribute matched their value. Otherwise the label is not connected to the radio button. 

Another important thing is that the groups that are together have the same `name` attribute



![Radio buttons](assets/radiobuttons.png)



### Select

Select is also used to select between a given set of options. It is typically used to select country. The difference from the radio buttons is that in select the user has the possibility to select multiple options!

```html
<select name="pets" id="pet-select">
    <option value="">--Please choose an option--</option>
    <option value="dog">Dog</option>
    <option value="cat">Cat</option>
    <option value="hamster">Hamster</option>
    <option value="parrot">Parrot</option>
    <option value="spider">Spider</option>
    <option value="goldfish">Goldfish</option>
</select>
```

It is similar to the `ul` and `li`. Inside of the `select` tag there has to be an `option` tag for each option the user can select. You can give the `option` tag a `value` but you dont have to



![Select list](assets/select box.png)



### Buttons

Buttons are used for some kind of interactivity. Should not be used as links!

```html
 <button>Click Me!</button> 
```



There are some more form fields but i have covered the most important ones here
