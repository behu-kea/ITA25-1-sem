## DOM exercise: Guess my number

The project is a game where you have to guess a number. Here are the rules

- When clicking the `Check!` `button` check if what the user wrote in the `input` matches the number they have to guess
  - If it's wrong increase the Score by 1 and clear the input
  - If it is correct and smaller than Highscore set the new score as the highscore and clear the input. Also show the correct number in the `?`
- If the `Again` `button` is clicked clear the score and the highscore and start from scratch
- Add a couple of extra features you think could be cool!

The starter for the project can be [found here](https://github.com/jonasschmedtmann/complete-javascript-course/tree/master/05-Guess-My-Number/starter). Create a new project and copy the files into a new project!
