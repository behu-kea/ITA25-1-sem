- What are the dimensions of data quality and what is their meaning?
- Data quality is multidimensional
  - Accuracy
  - Completeness
  - Timerelated dimensions
  - Consistency
- An intuitive definition of Data quality is the Datasets "Fitness for use" - Wang

Further definitons:

##### Accuracy

- Syntactic Accuraccy and semantic accuracy
- Edit distance comparison function that evaluate the distance between v and v'
  - Der er større forskel på ord med flere fejl - altså flere fejl giver en mindre præcision
- Syntactic Accurracy = Knye West
- Semantic Accuracy = The Matrix | Viggo Mortensen
- *From these examples, it is clear that detecting semantic accuracy is typically more involved than detecting syntactic accuracy.*
- A way to solve this: This requires the ability to recog- nize that two records refer to the same *real world entity*, a task often referred to as the *object identification problem*
- Duplication

##### Completeness

- *Completeness can be generically defined as »the extent to which data are of sufficient breadth, depth and scope for the task at hand«*
- Breadth, Depth and scope

##### Currency
