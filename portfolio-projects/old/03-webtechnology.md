- Functions
- DOM



**SNAK OM PLAGIAT INDEN DEN SKAL AFLEVERES: [https://mit.kea.dk/eksamensregler](https://mit.kea.dk/eksamensregler)**

De skal ikke bare aflevere noget de har fundet online!



**The project should be created individually**! 

In this project you have to **choose one** out of these 4 projectsüëá (or create your own)

**Datoer for portef√∏lje**: 23/10 - 29/10



## üåç Personal CO2 Emission Calculator - level 1

Create a web application that allows users to calculate their personal CO2 emissions based on their daily activities. This could be based on the distance they drive, the type of food they consume, their electricity usage, etc.

- Maybe a user inputs how many miles they drive in a week and the type of vehicle they own, and the website calculates their weekly CO2 emissions.
- Maybe a user inputs the type of food they consume in a week (vegetarian, non-vegetarian, vegan) and the website calculates the CO2 emissions based on their diet.
- Maybe a user inputs their monthly electricity bill, and the website estimates their CO2 emissions based on average energy sources.

If you cannot think of any idea, try researching common sources of personal CO2 emissions and see if you can incorporate them into your calculator!



### Requirements

- The user should input details about their daily activities.
- There should be a button that initiates the calculation.
- The application should display the calculated CO2 emissions based on the user's input.
- Should be deployable

## üßÆ Simple calculator

**Difficulty: level 1**

Create a calculator where a user can input some information and get a result from that information. 

- Maybe a user inputs how far you have to drive to work and the website calculates co2 emissions
- Maybe a caculator where you put in your birthday and the website tells you how many days, seconds, heartbeats, etc you have lived

If you cannot think of any idea then try and ask friends/family if they would like some kind of caluculator that could help them in their life!



### Requirements

- The user should put in some details
- There should be a button that initiates the calculation
- There should be some kind of calculation being done
